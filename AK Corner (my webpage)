        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an anime and tech enthusiast. I have a strong passion for anime, and my favorite is Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK). My favorite character from the series is Satoru Gojo, mainly due to his captivating personality.
        </p>

            In addition to my love for anime, I enjoy creating Roblox games for fun. My games are not pay-to-win, and you can check out one of my creations <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14730798256/Cursed-Japan">here</a>.

        <p>
            Feel free to reach out and connect with me. I'm always open to discussing anime, tech, or anything else of interest.
